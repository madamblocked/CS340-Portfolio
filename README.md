# CS340-Portfolio

I write programs that hold these qualities by considering every use case or intention that I have with a program. If I know that I may use some program in the future for some other purpose, I will make it as easy to understand and as adaptable as I can. For the best longevity of my code, I try to make it easy to understand. For the Python CRUD module, the advantage is its reusability -- I could use this in the future to interface with any other instance of MongoDB. As a computer scientist, I tend to have an analytical approach. With respect to Grazioso Salvare, I needed to understand the requirements and map out what was wanted. What would I need to do to implement those changes? This course required us to be precise and exact. Computer scientists are technology architects and engineers who develop computer-based solutions to optimize or automate processes in order to maximize efficiencies and make life easier for society. Computer science creates a lot of additional convenience in peoples' lives, but at the same time if gone wrong it can cause some amounts of chaos. It is essential as a software dev to build applications that are secure and sensible, but also documented for someone else to interpret and understand.
